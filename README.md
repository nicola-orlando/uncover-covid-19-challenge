Project collecting scripts for UNCOVER COVID-19 Challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/roche-data-science-coalition/uncover/ 

## List of ongoing tasks and information 

### Which populations are at risk of contracting COVID-19? [q1] 

***Relevant data*** 

* Need to use per-capita data: only available are covid_19_canada_open_data_working_group/public-covid-19-cases-canada.csv 
* Normalise the data to per-country infrastructure and intrinsic risks, basically all under HDE
* Other possibly interestind data: 
  * our_world_in_data has the relevant normalised test information maybe to cross correlated with Canadian per-capita data

### Which patient populations pass away from COVID-19? 

* Overall death/cases per country is here  worldometer-confirmed-cases-and-deaths-by-country-territory-or-conveyance.csv
* Testing locations crowd-sourced-covid-19-testing-locations.csv
* us-county-health-rankings-2020.csv (not sure has deadths from COVID-19)
* covid-statistics-by-us-states-daily-updates.csv has some possibly useful data on hospital data, similar for covid-statistics-by-us-states-totals.csv 
* einstein dataset has interesting features, possibly useful for a ML based analysis
